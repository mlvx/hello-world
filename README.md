## Brief bio.
I'm Mike.
Tall, dark (well, ethnically ambiguous, shall we say?), and handsome.
Snowboarder in winter; day hiker in summer.
Evangelistic about [Baduk](http://www.usgo.org/).  (Have you tried it?  If not, I'll happily show you how!)
Zealously increasing the ambient joy quotient, one interface at a time.

Huzzah!
