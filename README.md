Evangelistic about [Baduk](http://www.usgo.org/).  (Have you tried it?  If not, I'll happily show you how!)
Zealously increasing the ambient joy quotient, one interface at a time.

Huzzah!

2018-04-12T15:35 - This is just a meaningless edit, because I want to see the "this branch is nnn commits ahead of Master" counter increment.  Ah, life's simple pleasures.

2018-04-12T18:31 - This is an experiment to see what happens when two branches differ and you try to merge them.  I imagine that if different collaborators commit changes at the same time, then there can be hairiness.  That probably happens rarely; and when it does, I guess you can simply revert to an early "master" where everything worked, and resolve the diffs from there.  (This is "2b" because I branched from "1" instead of "master" before.)
